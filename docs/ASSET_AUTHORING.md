# Authoring assets

How to add content the engine can load. What happens to it afterwards is the
build pipeline's business — see [PIPELINE.md](PIPELINE.md).

## Source layout

Each asset is a pair of files in the asset source directory: a metadata
descriptor, and the raw source file it names.

```
<name>.json      metadata
<name>.png       the source file it points at
```

The source may be in any common format the cook stage can read. Nothing consumes
the source at runtime — only the cooked result is shipped.

## Metadata

```json
{
  "type": "TEXTURE",
  "source": "player_tex.png",
  "deps": []
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "MODEL",
  "source": "enemy.obj",
  "deps": ["enemy_tex"]
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | `TEXTURE` or `MODEL`. `SOUND` and `FONT` are enumerated but unimplemented |
| `source` | string | The raw source file, in the same directory |
| `deps` | string[] | Other assets this one needs, up to the format maximum |
| `format` | string | Preferred texture encoding. A platform cook list may override it |
| `mip_levels` | number | Mip levels to generate |

**Declare dependencies.** They are loaded before the asset that names them and
reference-counted, so a model is never reported ready before its textures, and a
texture in use cannot be evicted. One load request then suffices for a whole
object graph — the caller does not list the textures a model needs.

**Naming matters.** Assets are addressed by a canonical key derived from their
path, so the same asset referenced by device path and by baked dependency string
resolves to one entry rather than two. The rule is in
[formats/ARCHIVE_FORMAT.md](formats/ARCHIVE_FORMAT.md).

## Encoding is a platform decision

`format` is a preference, not an instruction. Each platform's cook list decides
what that platform actually wants, because the right encoding is a hardware
question — a palettised texture where video memory is scarce, a directly
uploadable one where it is not. See [PIPELINE.md](PIPELINE.md).

The consequence for authoring: **budget limits differ per platform**, and an
asset that fits one may be rejected on another. The constrained platform is the
one to check against. Its arithmetic is in
[ps2/TEXTURE_BUDGET.md](ps2/TEXTURE_BUDGET.md).

## Levels

A level names the resources it requires, and their types are inferred from the
assets themselves, so the list may freely mix kinds. Each is pinned on load so it
cannot be evicted mid-level.

**Loading a level is all-or-nothing.** If any required resource fails, everything
already pinned in that attempt is unpinned and unloaded and the load reports
failure, leaving the resource table and the texture budget exactly as they were.
There are no partial loads and no leaked pins.

## Checking your work

Cooked output can be inspected and validated without running the engine — headers,
dependency lists, encodings, sizes and budget usage. A validation failure names
the asset and the rule it broke. See [PIPELINE.md](PIPELINE.md).
